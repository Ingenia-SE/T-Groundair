# SysML model

The main intention of this model is being a common reference for developers taking part in the Project, but also for giving other people a general overview of our work.
Its structure is based in the potential physical implementation of the system, but it also includes some sections regarding simulation or requirements.
Please, for contributing to this dynamic model, follow the steps on the .pdf document ModelingManagement_guidelines.
Any additional contribution will be appreciated.
