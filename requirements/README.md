The system requirements can be consulted both from the .pdf document and from the SySML model that has been developed.

The pdf document can be opened with a pdf viewer like "Sumatra PDF" or "Adobe Reader".

The SySML model has been developed in the "Eclipse" development environment and the "Papyrus" add-on. To consult it, is necessary to clone the project in its file directory and open it with the tools previously mentioned.
