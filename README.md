The INGENIA-SE Drone Challenge 2019-2020

The Challenge of this project is to achieve an efficient cooperation between two autonomous robots: an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle(UGV). This is done through Model-based System Engineering (MBSE).

This repository is structured in three main sections:

- Requirements, where the system specifications and its validation procedures are defined.
- SysML Model, including the system's model for its characterization from different perspectives and also some guidelines for editing.
- Software, containing the different software packages which are necessary for the simulation.

The simulator used is Gazebo 11.
The operating system used is ROS Melodic.
The architecture is documented in SysML.
